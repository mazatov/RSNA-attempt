For the radiologists out there, this means that the images have been windowed and leveled already. In clinical practice, manipulating the image bit-depth is typically done manually by a radiologist to highlight certain disease processes. To visually assess the quality of the automated bit-depth downscaling and for considerations on potentially improving this baseline, consider consultation with a radiologist physician.\n",

For the purposes of this challenge, the diagnosis of most pneumonia cases can typically be made at this resolution. To visually assess the feasibility of diagnosis at this resolution, and to determine the optimal resolution for pneumonia detection (oftentimes can be done at a resolution *even smaller* than 1024 x 1024), consider consultation with a radiogist physician.\n",
